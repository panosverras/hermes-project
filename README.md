HERMES is a project created by **smartbirds** team (Greece) for their participation to the World Robot Olympiad^TM^ 2023.
~Team consists of 3 high school students, Niobe, Thymios, Faidon and their coach Mr. Panos Verras.~

## Why we created HERMES?

After lots of research on this season’s theme “Connecting the World”, we came to the idea of HERMES, a multifunctional robotic system that maintains a more stable telecommunication network/infrastructure working as single node (p2p) or in combination with other units (HERMES mesh network). HERMES is based on our research on the fields of today’s IT infrastructure, undersea cable networks, socio-economic impact of IT on our daily life, marine traffic, ship design, underwater and overwater scientific and climate data and UN Sustainability Goals.

Since the beginning of time, waterways have played an important role in human communications, linking geographies and societies far and wide. Today, water not only facilitates transportation and trade but also connects nations and continents across the globe through the worldwide system of computer networks. The internet connects over 5 billion people around the world, with an impressive 99% of data being transferred through undersea fiber-optic cables. Damage on the physical underwater infrastructure could cause a multitude of problems due to internet outage, especially in cases of remote areas where an entire community relies on a few cables or even just one.

Every year, the underwater communication network undergoes between 100 and 150 faults. Most of these cable faults occur in water depths shallower than 200 meters, within a distance of approximately 1000 meters from the coastline. The internet downtime period resulting from cable faults depends on weather and climate conditions and it may take up to several months for a complete repair. Moreover, as global overseas shipping continues to grow and thus traffic in shallower waters surges, cable incidents and pollution will only increase, especially in congestion points, such as canals and rivers.

Loss of internet connectivity presents significant challenges for nations, governments and everyday people. However, the complete absence of internet access in remote regions is equally detrimental. Extending internet access to remote areas ultimately gives these communities access to vital resources and services by helping them connect to the rest of the world.

The problems arising from lack of internet access are numerous and complex, so innovative ideas and advanced technologies are the solution. Our project, HERMES, can help.

HERMES is an innovative robotic solution designed to act as a data bypass link in the event of an undersea cable fault, ensuring uninterrupted data flow. HERMES can also replace the role of underwater fiber-optic cables near the shore and therefore open valuable sea lanes that were restricted to protect those cables. Additionally, HERMES can provide an internet connection to remote regions. The robot also has environmental monitoring functions and other capabilities which focus on its surroundings.

## How we created HERMES
HERMES system consists of 3 parts, although its name was given by the main vessel.

- Underwater station: this station could be attached to the already existing underwater cable repeaters and convert wired signal to wireless and vice-versa.
- HERMES: HERMES is able navigate autonomusly anywhere on the planet and receive and retransmit wireless signal from both under and over water stations (such as other HERMES or land station, or underwater station). Additionally, we developed some more additional functionallities this USV:
  -   HERMES can act as a remote IOT station with its capability to collect environment data
  -   HERMES can warn nearby ships about potential dangers using the International Code of Signals
  -   HERMES can help in search and rescue missions as it can detect life in water
- Land station: Land station can receive signal from HERMES and convert it to wired (forwardning it to the existing land cable network), and vice-versa.
